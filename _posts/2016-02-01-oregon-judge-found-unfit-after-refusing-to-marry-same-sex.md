description: 'A Hitler-loving, gay-hating Oregon judge who refused to perform same-sex marriages because of "sincerely held religious beliefs" has been found "unfit" for the bench. The nine-member panel made the rare recommendation of removing Day from the bench after determining in a two-week hearing that Day had undermined public trust by refusing to marry same-sex couples.'
